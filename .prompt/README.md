Personal Website Skeleton
=========================

How to use
----------

1) Open `index.html` in a browser. All pages share `assets/css/style.css`.
2) Replace placeholders "Your Name" and text across pages with your info.
3) Put your portrait at `images/profile.jpg`.
4) Optional: place a PDF resume at `assets/resume.pdf` and uncomment the embed in `resume.html`.
5) Update project images at `images/project1.jpg` and `images/project2.jpg` and set demo/source links.
6) On `contact.html`, set your email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and replace the form `action` with Formspree/Getform/Netlify endpoint.

PROPMT1: I want to make a personal website and I want you to create the following skeleton "Homepage (index.html), About Me (about.html), Resume (resume.html), Projects (projects.html), Contact (contact.html). I want you to create these files, and make it so I input all my personal info for each file".

OUTPUT1: Created the full skeleton with shared styles and all pages. Next, you can fill in your details and images.
Files added: index.html, about.html, resume.html, projects.html, contact.html, assets/css/style.css, assets/resume.pdf (placeholder), images/.gitkeep, assets/.gitkeep, README.md.
How to customize:
Replace "Your Name" and intro text on all pages.
Put your portrait at images/profile.jpg.
Update project images images/project1.jpg, images/project2.jpg and links.
Add your PDF at assets/resume.pdf and uncomment the embed in resume.html if desired.
In contact.html, set your email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and replace the form action with your endpoint.
Open index.html to preview locally.

NOTES1: I accepted these changes and I added a .prompt folder and added the read me to it. 

PROMPT2: Insert the pdf and jpeg I just added to the images file, if you need to move the pdf go for it. Also, make the style different - make the website light green and white, redo how the portrate is. Also, in the resume.html, just have my resume full screened (no highlight of it like how it is now).
OUTPUT 2: Switched to a light green/white theme and modernized components in assets/css/style.css (fixed :root, updated colors, buttons, and portrait).
Updated portrait to your new JPEG:
index.html image now images/MSIS_Headshot_2025.jpg
about.html image now images/MSIS_Headshot_2025.jpg
Made resume.html a full-screen PDF viewer of images/Dzubay_Mischa_MSIS.pdf (no panel/sections).
NOTES2: I accepted the changes, and then changed the green color
